## Explanation:

Here’s a brief explanation of each file used in the Countdown Timer project:

1. HTML (index.html)
Purpose:
The HTML file provides the structure of the web page. It defines the elements that users interact with, such as input fields, buttons, and the countdown display.
---
## Key Sections:
1. Heading : Displays the title "Countdown Timer."
2. Input Fields:Date 
3. Input: Allows users to select a target date.
4. Time input: Allows users to select a target time.
5. Start Button: Initiates the countdown.
6. Countdown Display:Divided into four time units: Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds. Each unit dynamically updates during the countdown.
7. Message Area: Displays a message when the timer reaches zero (e.g., "Time's up!").

## CSS (styles.css) Purpose:
The CSS file defines the visual appearance of the page, making it attractive and user-friendly.

## Key Features:
1. Overall Layout:
Centers the timer container on the page using flexbox.
2. Timer Container:
Styled with a light background, padding, and rounded corners to give a clean look.
3. Input and Button Styling:
Inputs and buttons are styled for consistent sizing, spacing, and hover effects.
4. Countdown Display:
Each time unit (days, hours, minutes, seconds) is displayed inside a styled box with:
A bold font for numbers.
Labels below (e.g., "Days," "Hours").
5. Responsive Design:
Layout adapts to different screen sizes for better usability.
##  JavaScript (script.js)
 Purpose:
The JavaScript file adds functionality to the timer, handling user interactions and updating the countdown in real-time.
## Key Logic:
1. Start Button Click Event:
Captures the target date and time from the user’s inputs.
Validates that both inputs are filled; otherwise, shows an alert.
2. Countdown Calculation:
Calculates the remaining time (difference between the target date and the current time).
3. Breaks down the remaining time into:
Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
4. Real-Time Updates:
Uses setInterval() to update the countdown every second.
Dynamically updates the <span> elements for days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
5. Countdown Completion:
Stops the timer when the target time is reached.
Displays "Time's up!" in the message area.
How They Work Together
